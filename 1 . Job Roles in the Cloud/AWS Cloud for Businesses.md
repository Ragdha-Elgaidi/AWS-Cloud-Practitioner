# AWS Cloud for Businesses
### The traditional on-premises model for managing IT applications and infrastructure 
- It is highly manual and often uses expensive equipment at less than full capacity. In contrast, an AWS Cloud environment helps businesses drive innovation because of its ability to increase development speed and provide near-limitless scale. And the speed, scale, innovation, and productivity benefits help businesses pursue bigger, broader digital opportunities, now and in the future. 


##### Speed:
- With the AWS Cloud, organizations can experiment with applications and new business models at lower cost and greater speed. 


##### Scale: 
- The AWS Cloud creates opportunities for organizations to scale products almost instantaneously to a broader set of customer segments, geographies, and channels.     


##### Innovation: 
- Using the AWS Cloud means that roles that were once required for on premises will move to a shared responsibility model. This frees up your team to innovate and use technologies such as advanced analytics, the Internet of Things, or IoT, and automation at scale.

 

##### Productivity:
- The adoption of cloud principles such as infrastructure and security as code helps to automate compliance and other routine processes, which speeds up productivity.  


### The AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure 
- It is the most secure, extensive, and reliable cloud platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Whether you need to deploy your application workloads across the globe in a single click or you want to build and deploy specific applications closer to your end-users with single-digit millisecond latency, AWS provides you the cloud infrastructure where and when you need it.
